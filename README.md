# practice-bidding
A short program to allow practice of new bidding systems in Bridge.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:
From the command line, "python C:\path\to\robot_bidding.py" will use the
XML_DEFAULT_SOURCE constant to locate the XML file describing the bidding
system you wish to use, if you enter "default" when asked for the XML file
location. Otherwise you may enter the file location at that point.

Alternatively, "python C:\path\to\robot_bidding.py C:\path\to\system.xml"
will use the XML file located at "C:\path\to\system.xml"

You may wish to edit the XML_DEFAULT_SOURCE constant for your own usage.
Please do not commit these changes.
If you refactor it, please create a .bat file for me to use as a replacement.
